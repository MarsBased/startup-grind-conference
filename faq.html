              Will I meet investors or speakers if I attend the conference?

                Though our speakers for the monthly event stay for the
                networking part, most speakers are busy founders who do us the
                great favor of sharing their time pro-bono exactly because they
                know we won’t demand much of it. All speakers are encouraged to
                meet attendees, walk the floor, and enjoy the conference — but
                we make no guarantees.
              </p>
              <p>
                There will, however, investors and VIPs among the audience who
                have already bought a ticket, including some of our former
                speakers — many who’d love to meet you. In our other
                conferences, there was over $1 million offered to founders by
                investors they met during the two days of the event, some who
                randomly bumped into one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our secret to spotting &amp; connecting with VIPs: say hello to
                those people who seem relaxed and sit back during networking
                breaks, as many of them will be those whose networks are already
                incredible. If they don’t invest, it’s likely they know those
                who do — so make friends instead of pitching hard.

              Yes: comfortable. Expect some people to feel most comfortable
              dressed in formal business attire – it can be a nice confidence
              booster. Also expect to mingle with an entrepreneurial crowd
              that’s most comfortable in casual streetwear, maybe accented with
              a company hoodie. Keep in mind the amazing people you’ll be
              meeting at this conference, and dress to impress and connect with
              them. However you style yourself, make sure it’s respectful of the
